A quiz game with 3 different options

This web app was built using HTML, SCSS & vanilla Javascript. 

It features 3 different quiz options with animatated CSS to bring these options to life.

Each quiz has 10 questions with multiple choice options. An accumulative score is kept at the top of the page.

This score can then be saved in local storage.

This was a challenging project as I struggled in parts with some of the JS.

I feel this quiz game could be enhanced by a) showing the correct answer if you incorrectly guess; and b) having a separate leaderboard for each quiz game.
